# Contributing to the *Scripts* collection

First of all, thank you for being a part of this and the wider GitHub community! :heart:

## Code of conduct

[![Code of Conduct](./CONTRIBUTING.svg)][code of conduct]

Please adhere to the [code of conduct][code of conduct] which is
 adapted from the [contributor covenant 2.0][cc2].

**The [tl;dr][tldr] of this is be kind, be patient, and be respectful to others.**

If you see any abuse or violation of GitHub's Terms of Service, please report
it, either using GitHub's [**report abuse**][github report] page.

## Issues

If you've found a bug, have a suggestion/request for improvement, or have a
question that can't be answered by reading the help documentation for a script,
please [**create an issue**][new issue]. There are currently three issue
templates. A bug report, feature request, and question. Select the most
appropriate and you will be provided with a template for creating an issue.

To fill in an issue template, leave any `## Headings` and `---` dividers in
place, and replace the paragraph(s) under each heading with the requested
information. There are numbered comment hints to show you which bits to
replace:

```html
<!-- 1 Replace below here 1 -->
...
<!-- 1 Replace above here 1 -->
```

Please read the paragraphs between the hints before you replace them! They are
useful guidance for writing a helpful issue.

### Creation

If you've forked from the repository and have made improvements or bug fixes,
you are welcome to [**open a pull request**][pulls]. Like [**Issues**](#issues)
above, there is a pull request template you can use when creating one. Please
read the guidance in the previous heading which explains how to use the
template.

### Requirements

Please use a consistent coding style appropriate for the language the script is
written in, for example in [Java][java style] or [PowerShell][pwsh style].
Maintaining consistency with the existing style will also help other developers
and will increase the likelihood of your pull request being merged.

### Merging

This project is released under the [**MIT License**][license] and the rights
to any code, submitted via pull requests or otherwise, will be those of the
license. You may ask for your contributions to be removed at any time, but this
will not affect the rights applied to any derivatives of this project that
include this code.

All constructive and beneficial pull requests are considered, but please do not
be offended if they are not merged. As this project is released under the
[**MIT License**][license], you are welcome to derive from this source in your
own projects, so long as you include attribution and the
[original text][license]. Any non-code assets are released under
[**CC BY-SA 4.0**][ccbysa4].

### Commit signing

The repository does not currently require [GPG][gpg] commit
 signatures, but this may change in future. You should consider this anyway!
 It is free, relatively straightforward to set up, and adds an extra level of
 authenticity to your work. Read more about code signing
 [**here**][code signing].
