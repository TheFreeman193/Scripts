# Scripts

A compilation of scripts borne of a programmer's worst enemy and best friend; __Laziness__.

## What this is

The files here are more polished versions of various scripts I have written.
Some of them might not work for you, but the vast majority are generic for language in which they are written.

## Using these scripts in your source

These scripts are all released under the [GNU General Public License][about_license]. This means the [latest][latest_license] GNU GPL applies to them, which is currently the [GPLv3][gnugplv3].

The tl;dr of this is that you're permitted to use and modify my code, provided you reference me wherever you use it, and don't use it in proprietary software ([Contact me][email] to obtain permission for this).

## Contributing

If you fork from this repository and have made improvements, I welcome [Pull Requests][pulls] that make beneficial changes, optimisations, and updates.

## Experimental scripts

I also [keep a collection][script_dump] of much less-polished scripts, which is more for inspiration and education purposes. You can find it [here][script_dump].
