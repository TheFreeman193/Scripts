# About *Scripts*

[![License](./LICENSE.svg)][license]
[![Code of Conduct](./CONTRIBUTING.svg)][conduct]

A compilation of scripts borne of a programmer's worst enemy and best friend;
__Laziness__.

## What this is

The files here are more polished versions of various scripts I have written.
Some of them might not work for you, but the vast majority are generic for
the languages in which they are written.

## Why it's here

The scripts are for reference, use in snippets, and educational purposes. Every
developer does things a little differently, and looking at others' approaches
is a valuable source of learning.

## Using these scripts in your source

These scripts are all released under the [MIT License][license].

The tl;dr of this is that you're permitted to use, modify and redistribute my
code, provided you reference the [original license text][license] wherever you
use it. You can even use it in proprietary software (I would be very grateful
if you [dropped me an email][email] to let me know in such cases).

## Contributing

If you fork from this repository and have made improvements, I welcome
[Pull Requests][pulls] that make beneficial changes, optimisations, and
updates.

## Code of conduct

Please adhere to the [code of conduct][conduct] which is adapted from the
[contributor covenant 2.0][latest_conduct]. Remember, we are a *community*.

## Experimental scripts

I also [keep a collection][script_dump] of much less-polished scripts, which
primarily exists for inspiration, education, and amusement.
