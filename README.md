# About *Scripts*

[![License](./LICENSE.svg)][license] [![Code of Conduct](./CONTRIBUTING.svg)][conduct]

A compilation of scripts borne of a programmer's worst enemy and best friend; __Laziness__.

## What this is

The files here are more polished versions of various scripts I have written.
Some of them might not work for you, but the vast majority are generic for language in which they are written.

## Why it's here

The scripts included here are for reference, use in snippets, and educational purposes. Every developer does things a little differently, and looking at others' approaches is a valuable source of learning.

## Using these scripts in your source

These scripts are all released under the [MIT License][license].

The tl;dr of this is that you're permitted to use and modify my code, provided you reference me wherever you use it. You can even use it in proprietary software (I would very grateful if you [drop me an email][email] to let me know in such cases).

## Contributing

If you fork from this repository and have made improvements, I welcome [Pull Requests][pulls] that make beneficial changes, optimisations, and updates.

## Code of conduct

Please adhere to the **[code of conduct][conduct]** which is adapted from the [contributor covenant 2.0][cc2].
Remember, we are a *community*.

## Experimental scripts

I also [keep a collection][script_dump] of much less-polished scripts, which is more for inspiration and education purposes.
