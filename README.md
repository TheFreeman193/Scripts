# About *Scripts*

[![License][img license]][license]
[![Code of Conduct][img conduct]][conduct]

A compilation of scripts borne of a programmer's worst enemy and best friend;
__Laziness__.

## What is this?

The files here are more polished versions of various scripts I have written.
Some of them might not work for you, but the vast majority are generic for
the languages in which they are written.

## Why's it here?

The scripts are for reference, use in snippets, and educational purposes. Every
developer does things a little differently, and looking at others' approaches
is a valuable source of learning.

## Can I use these scripts in my source?

Yes! These scripts are all released under the **[MIT License][license]**.

The [tl;dr][tldr] of this is that you're permitted to use, modify and redistribute my
code, provided you include the [original license text][license] wherever you
use it. You can even use it in proprietary software (I would be very grateful
if you [dropped me an email][email] to let me know in such cases).

## Contributing

If you've found a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or ask a question, you
can create an issue. If you would like to make improvements or fix bugs, I also
welcome pull requests that make beneficial changes. Please see
**[Contributing][contrib]** for more information on issues and pull requests.

## Code of conduct

Please adhere to the [**code of conduct**][conduct] which is adapted from the
[contributor covenant 2.0][latest_conduct]. Remember, we are a *community*.

## Experimental scripts

I also [keep a collection][script_dump] of much less-polished scripts, which
primarily exists for inspiration, education, and amusement.
